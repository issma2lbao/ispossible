## Overview

Buttons are clickable elements that are used to trigger actions. They
communicate calls to action to the user and allow users to interact with pages
in a variety of ways. `Button` labels express what action will occur when the
user interacts with it.

<Canvas>
  <Story of={ButtonStories.Primary} />
  <Story of={ButtonStories.Primary} />
</Canvas>

## Component API

<ArgsTable />

Additional props passed into `Button` will be forwarded along to the underlying
button element.

### Button `as`

This prop allows you to specify a different element to be rendered as a
`Button`. You may also need to add a [role](#button-role) for accessibility if
an element other than a `button` is rendered.

```jsx
<Button type="text">I'm a div tag</Button>
```

### Button `size`

This prop specifies which size the `Button` should be rendered at. Valid values
are `sm`, `md`, `lg`, `xl`, and `2xl`. If no `size` is specified, it renders as
`lg`.

<Button>Submit</Button> <Button type="primary">Submit</Button> <Button type="text">
  Submit
</Button> <Button type="link">Submit</Button>

```jsx
<Button>Submit</Button>
<Button type="primary">Submit</Button>
<Button type="text">Submit</Button>
<Button type="link">Submit</Button>
```

### Unstyled

<Unstyled>
  <Button type="primary">Submit</Button>
</Unstyled>
